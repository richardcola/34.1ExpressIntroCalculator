/* JSON a data interchange format often used for data exchange between a server and a web application or between two different parts of a program

JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript language and represents data as key-value pairs. 

A file with a .json extension is typically a text file that contains data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON files are used to store and exchange structured data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. These files are often used for configuration settings, data storage, and data interchange, especially in web development and various software applications.

The content of a .json file consists of JSON data, which can include objects, arrays, key-value pairs, and their associated values.
